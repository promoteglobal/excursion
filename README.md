# excursion
Nice mockup of a an app.

### Description:
Practiced html semantics and css, git commands and self code review from looking at solution

### Technologies and credits:
Just a simple html/css project.  I built all files from scratch.  I only followed a picture with a description of what css was needed.

### Lessons learned:
I learned not to make all commits in the wrong working directory.  You only get to see last few commits.

### Website:  
Simple website: (https://promoteglobal.github.io/excursion/)
